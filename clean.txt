when their rebel leader field marshal dedan kimathi was captured and hanged by the colonialists a street in nairobi would later be named after him and other freedom fighters another freedom fighter and the man that eventually became kenya first president jomo kenyatta was also charged with directing the maumau and was sentenced to year imprisonment 		riria muthongoria wao field marshal dedan kimathi anyitiirwo na guitwo ni athungu aathani bara thiini wa nairobi thuthaini gwitanio na ritwa riake na aruiri wiathi angi muruiri wiathi ungi na muthuri uria muisho ini watwikire muthamaki wa mbere wa kenya jomo kenyatata niathitangirwo gutongoria maumau na agitwiirwo mwaka kioho ini 
kenya was then put under a state of emergency from october to december because of this maumau rebellion against the british colonial rule which saw thousands of kenyans being incarcerated in detention camps it is at this time that african participation in the political process increased and in the africans europeans and asians were admitted into the kenya legislative council on a representative basis		kenya niyashokire ikiigwo rungu rwa state of emergency kuuma waikumi nginya wa ikumunakeeri niundu wa uu mbara ya maumau kuri wathani wa muthungu uria woonire makiri ma akenya makiohwo kambiini ni thiini wa mahinda maya niguo unyitaniiri wa africa thiini wa mitaratara ya uteti yongererekire na andu a afrika athungu na ahindi maingiririo thiini wa kanjo ya legistlative niundu wa kurugamirira

the following year kenya became a republic with the man now referred to as mzee jomo kenyatta as her first president it was also in the same year that kenya joined the british commonwealth mzee kenyatta would then go on to lead the country until his death in  august 		mwaka ucio wabuatire kenya igituika bururi wa kwiyatha kuria muthuri uiikaini ta muthee jomo kenyatta ta president wake wa mbere no thiini wa mwaka uyu kuria kenya yaingirire british common wealth muthee jomo kenyatta niagishokire agithie naambere gutongoria bururi nginyagia gikuo giake wakanana 
the moi era following the death of kenya first president in the then vice president daniel toroitich arap moi succeeded him as kenya second president at this point kenya was a de facto single party state in june the country was officially declared a one party state by the national assembly and the constitution was amended accordingly		wathani wa moi kuumana na gikuo kia muthamaki wa mbere wa kenya uria wari kahinda ini kau munini wa muthamaki daniel toroitich arap moi guthii nambere ta muthamaki wa keeri wa kenya gukinyagia hau kenya yari bururi wa kiama kimwe kia de facto  wagatadatu bururi niwaniriirwo wa kiama kimwe ni national assembly na katiba gucokerwo kulingana
the parliamentary elections were held in september under a single party for the first time and the elections reinforced the one party system in december however parliament annulled the one party section of the constitution seeing a diversity of new parties formed in early 		ithuurano cia mbunge ciahanikire wakenda rungu rwa kiama kimwe ari rita ria mbere na ithuurano kunyitirira mutaratara wa kiama kimwe mweri waaikuminakeeri thengia ya uguo mbunge niyakajire gishuji gia kiama kimwe gia katiba kuona ugayukano wa ciama njeru iria ciathondekirwo tene

it is important to mention that the were a difficult time for many kenyans during this time kenya floundered economically there were numerous ethnic conflicts between the kalenjins and  the kikuyus and there was also evidence of widespread corruption 		ni hari bata kugweta ati nikwari na ihinda  iritu kuri akenya aingi hindi ino akenya nimagiire ihinda iritu kimuuhuko nikwari na njukaniriro nyingi cia gikabila gatagati ka akalenjin na agikuyu na nikwari na uira wa ungumanai mugwatu 
it is also in the same period where the international community pressed unsuccessfully for constitutional reform to give the opposition parties a fair chance against kanu the ruling party of key importance is moi achievements during his reign he is remembered for having maintained national and political stability and he also presided over the expansion of the education sector at all levels the president finally retired in having completed terms in office		no thiini wa ihinda riri kuria ituura ria kimabururi riatindikire gutari maciaro gucejio gwa katiba kuhe ciama cia mung ethaniro kanya kaigananu ga gucidana na kanu kiama kiria giatongoragia ma kuhinyia ni achievements cia moi hindi ya wathani wake aririkanagwo ni gukorwo amenyereire thayu wa bururi na kiuteti na niathamakire iguru ria waramia wa sekta ya githomo kuri levels ciothe muthamaki muishoini niaritaire arikia itiina ria wafisi

kibaki was the party elected candidate receiving of the total votes in the elections and of the total parliamentary seats his and his party tasks in the new administration included restoring the country economic growth generating employment opportunities that would absorb the high number of the unemployed especially the youth and reduction of high levels of poverty in the country		kibaki niwe wari muhuraniri giti muthure na kwamukira kura cia thiini wa githuurano na iti cia mbunge wira wake na kiama giake utongoriaini mweru wegie gucokia ukuria wa kimuhuko wa bururi guthondeka mianya iria ingiagushirie namba nene ya aria matari mawira muno mbeu njithi na kunyihia icunji nene cia ukia thiini wa bururi

we would have no trouble understanding these references because they entail familiar history and geography but when we read that isaiah sees a warrior coming from edom in garments we don t get what this means because we dont know that edom represents the enemies of god and his people throughout the old testament when amos talks about the cows of amos we dont laugh out loud like we should because we dont immediately get that 		tutingiri na thiina kunyiita maundu maya tondu makonie maundu ma tene maria manahanika  no riria twa thoma ati isaiah ona agiuka kuuma edom na nguo tutiranyita kiria giki kirauga tondu tutiramenya ati edom irarugamirira thuu cia ngai na andu ake thiini wa kirikaniro gikuru riaria amos araria megie ng ombe cia amos tutiratheka na hinya uria tubatie tondu tutiranyita orio ati 
amos is referring to rich lazy women who dont care about the poor second reason we struggle to understand the prophetic books is that easily bored or confused by their repetitive oracles some of these books tell us a story such as jonah and daniel but much  of the content in the prophetic books is made up of oracles with no sense of chronological order 		amos araririria atumia atongu iguta aria matamenyagirira athini gitumi gia keri nituonaga hinya kunyiita mabuku ma urathi niati nitunogaga uhuthu kana gutukanirwo ni gucokera kwa mirumaniriro mamwe ma mabuku maya matwiraga ng ano ta cia jonah daniel no maingi ma maundu thiini wa mabuku ma urathi mathondeketwo ni murumaniriro utari na muthingi kana mutaratara

and you allow jehovah to talk to you  as it were  when you regularly read his written word and meditate on it 		nake jehova akwaragiria riria urathoma kiugo giake na ugecuurania uhoro wakio utegutiriria 
does god’s word provide counsel to help us if we face this ugly side of imperfect human behavior 	hihi kiugo kia ngai ni gikoragwo na utaaro ungituteithia tungicemania na undu ta ucio 
what is the meaning of the greek word that the bible uses to describe the compassion of jesus 	kiugo gia kingiriki kiria kihuthagiruo ni bibilia gutaariria tha cia jesu kiugite atia 
although we may be tired physically  we use our energy to preach god’s word  make return visits  and conduct bible studies 	o na tungikoruo turi anogu  ni tuhuthagira hinya witu kuhunjia  gucokera andu  na kumaruta bibilia 
“but you  son of man  do not be afraid of them + and do not be afraid of their words  although you are surrounded by briars and thorns*+ and are dwelling among scorpions 	“no wee muru wa mundu ri  ndukametigire + na ndugetigire ciugo ciao  o na gutuika uthiururukiirio ni miigua*+ na ugaikara gatagati ini ga tung’auru 
jesus did not qualify the word “all ” as if to limit his belongings to earthly things 	jesu ndoigire ati indo ciake “ciothe” no iria iri guku thi 
acts  :       philip responded by helping the eunuch gain an accurate knowledge of god’s word 		 :       nake filipu agiteithia mundu ucio agie na utauku uria wagiriire wa kiugo kia ngai 
however  the individual must also be willing to build a vocabulary filled with good words —words that impart what is favorable  words that build up— and then use these regularly  —rom 	o na kuri uguo  no muhaka mundu ucio akoruo ehaariirie kwiruta ciugo njega—cia kuguna  cia gwaka—na acihuthagire hingo ciothe —rom 
february: is there a creator who cares about you  the bible —god’s word or man’s  or the secret of family happiness 		februari: ahunjia no maheane rimwe ria mabuku maya: je  kuna muumba anayekujali  biblia—neno la mungu au la binadamu  na siri ya kupata furaha ya familia 
the watchtower series “learn from god’s word” has been designed to help publishers do this 	gicunji kiria kirikoragwo ngathiti ini ya murangiri “rutwo ni kiugo kia ngai” kihaariirio kiri gia guteithia ahunjia meke uguo 
these words are trustworthy  and i want you to keep stressing these matters  so that those who have believed god may keep their minds focused on maintaining fine works 	ciugo icio ni cia kwihokeka  na ngwenda uthii na mbere gutitirithia maundu macio  niguo aria metikitie ngai maigage meciria mao hari gutuuria ciiko njega 
that we may honor you in word and deed 		tugukumagie na ciiko citu 
so jehovah did according to moses’ word  and the gadflies departed from pharʹaoh  his servants  and his people 		+    nake jehova agika o ta uria musa aamuhoire  na ngi icio ikieherera firauni  ndungata ciake  na andu ake 
god’s word teems with accounts of faithful men and women who feared jehovah  put faith in him  and became his close friends 	bibilia ni yaritie uhoro wa athuri na atumia aingi ehokeku aria meetigirite jehova  maamwihokete  na magituika arata ake a hakuhi 
at the time of creation  jehovah spoke these words  evidently to his son: “let us make man in our image  according to our likeness ”	hindi ya uumbi  jehova eerire muru wake uu: “nituumbeni andu matarii ta muhianire witu  mahaanane na ithui ”

“from the year of jo·siʹah+ son of aʹmon  the king of judah  to this day  these years  the word of jehovah has come to me  and i kept speaking to you again and again * but you would not listen 	“kuuma mwaka wa    wa josia+ muru wa amoni  muthamaki wa juda  nginya umuthi uyu  miaka iyo     kiugo kia jehova ni kinginyiire  na ngoretwo ngimwira ringi na ringi * no mutithikagiriria

so the king did not listen to the people  for this turn of events was caused by the true god + in order to carry out the word that jehovah had spoken through a·hiʹjah+ the shiʹlo·nite to jer·o·boʹam the son of neʹbat	kwoguo muthamaki akiaga guthikiriria andu acio  ni gukoruo ngai uria wa ma niwe watumire maundu mathii uguo + nigetha kiugo kiria jehova eerite jeroboamu muru wa nebati kugerera ahija+ uria mushiloni kihinge

before they make judgments respecting fellow believers  elders need to pray for the help of jehovah’s spirit and depend on its guidance by consulting god’s word and the publications of the faithful and discreet slave class  —matt		athuri matanamba gutuithania akristiano aria angi  marabatara kuhoya uteithio wa roho wa jehova na kwihoka utongoria wa roho ucio na njira ya gucaria utaaro wa kiugo kia ngai na wa mabuku maria macabitwo ni ngombo iria iihokekete na njugi —mat 
in reply he said to them: “my mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of god and do it ”	nake akimacokeria akimeera atiri: “maitu na ariu a maitu ni aya maiguaga kiugo kia ngai na magagiathikira ”
such a man reads god’s word “in an undertone day and night ”		athomaga kiugo kia ngai “[na kiheehu] muthenya o na utuku ”
we can contribute to the spiritual cleanness of the congregation by following the direction found in god’s word		no tuteithiririe kiungano gikoruo kiri githeru kiiroho na njira ya kurumagirira utongoria kuuma kiugo ini kia ngai 
wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words  on going out of that house or that city  shake the dust off your feet ” —matthew		na riria mundu o wothe aaga kumunyita ugeni kana kumuthikiriria  mukiuma gwake kana ituura ini riu  ringithiai maguru manyu thi rukungu ruitike ” —mathayo   :       
during the though  a few sincere students of the bible scrutinized that teaching and saw that it had no support in god’s word 		no miaka ini ya andu anini aria maathuthuragia bibilia mari na muoroto mwega ni maatuiririe urutani ucio  makiona ati ndwanyitagwo mbaru ni kiugo kia ngai

for i will not presume to speak about anything except what christ has done through me in order for the nations to be obedient  by my word and deed with the power of signs and wonders *+ with the power of god’s spirit  so that from jerusalem and in a circuit as far as il·lyrʹi·cum i have thoroughly preached the good news about the christ 		ni gukoruo ndikwaria uhoro ungi tiga o uria kristo ekite kugerera hari nii niguo nduriri ciathike  kugerera kiugo giakwa na ciiko ciakwa     na hinya wa imenyithia na maundu ma magegania *+ na hinya wa roho wa ngai  kuuma jerusalemu na guthiururuka nginya iluriko ni hunjitie kihinyio uhoro uria mwega wigii kristo

some years later peter still recalled the experience and how it made “the prophetic word” more sure for him  — pe  :      		miaka    thutha ucio  petero no aaririkanaga uria kioneki kiu giatumire agie na witikio makiria hari “kiugo kia urathi ”— pe  :      
to demonstrate that those words were not an empty promise jesus then approached the tomb and cried out: “lazarus  come out ”		nigetha jesu onanie ati undu ucio oigaga wari wa ma aakuhiriirie mbirira na akianirira na mugambo munene akiuga: “lazaro  uma ”
but of what use would that be to him if he did not understand the meaning of the words being spoken	no hihi no tugunike angikoruo tutirataukiruo ni ciugo iria araria 
in other words the end of the seven times would mark the start of the rulership of god’s heavenly kingdom 	uguo ni kuuga ati  muthia wa mahinda macio mugwanja  niguo ungiari kiambiriria kia wathani wa uthamaki wa ngai 
luke in speaking of the seed sown on rocky ground  jesus means the hearts of people who receive the word with joy but the word does not take root deep in their hearts		luka akiaria uhoro wa mbeu iria ciaguire mahiga iguru jesu araria uhoro wa ngoro cia andu aria metikagira uhoro makenete no uhoro ucio ukaaga gukoruo na miri ngoro ini ciao 
the counsel of god’s word and suggestions of the elders helped me to realize that what i was really seeking was association with people who do not love jehovah 	utaaro wa kiugo kia ngai na wa athuri a kiungano ni wandeithirie kuona ati kiria ndaacaragia ni urata na andu matendete jehova 
if you apply god’s word  you will be a happier person		watumira kiugo kia ngai  niurikoraguo uri mundu mukenu makiria 
this is the word that jehovah has spoken against him:		giki nikio kiugo kiria jehova oigite kumwerekera:
the right words must be emphasized	no muhaka ciugo iria ciagiriire ciikiruo hinya
